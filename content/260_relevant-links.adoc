Purpose
-------
This section should duplicate and consolidate any links to external resources
contained elsewhere in this document.  The intention is to create a single
reference point for all external resources.

As of this version the process of consolidating external links is manual.  At
some point this process may be scripted.  (If you take it upon yourself to
script the process, please share it with the CER WG so it can be incorporated
into the process!)

Sample
