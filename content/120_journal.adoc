Purpose
-------

Activities
------
Provide a single-line summary for each activity performed on a given day.  The
recommended format is "<summary><verb>", where "summary" is a brief description
of the activity, and "verb" is either "started", "progressed" or "completed".
This will help to capture tasks which span multiple days.

Note that this journal can be tracked daily or weekly, depending on how the 
project decides to record the information.

When an activity correlates with a task from the Statement of Work, try to use
the same verbiage as in the SOW to describe it.  This will greatly simplify
later reviews of this document.

Use good judgment when deciding which activities to list and which to omit.
A good starting point is to add:
- Any activity which requires 30 minutes or more to complete
- Tasks which are foundational or critical to the engagement regardless of time
  required
- Tasks which were not part of the Statement of Work but added per customer
  request

It is strongly recommended that the consultant update this part of the CER on a
daily basis to ensure all significant activity is captured.

Blockers
------
Provide a single-line summary for each blocker present in a given day.   The
recommended format is "<summary><verb>" where "summary" is a brief description
of the activity and "verb" is either "encountered", "ongoing" or "resolved".
This will help to capture the duration and impact of blockers.

Try to refrain from detailed explanations of blockers in this section.  Place
relevant details in the "Challenges" area of the CER and try to use the first
sentence of the Challenge description as the summary here.

PROTIP: Avoid duplication of effort with project status reports.  
If a delivery team elects to use the optional "Journal" component in the 
CER then those updates should be used by the Project Manager to compile updates 
for the project status report. If the "Journal" is not in use then 
information for the status report will be provided separately to the 
Project Manager by the Consultant/Architect(s) on the engagement.
