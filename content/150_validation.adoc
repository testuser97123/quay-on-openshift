Purpose
-------
In the "Base" directory, this section is a placeholder which is to be
overwritten by validation steps specific to the product or products being
delivered.

If "TODO" appears in your document after the init script has been run, then
your product directory is missing a corresponding "validation.adoc" which
should be implemented to provide a basic validation framework for that product.
