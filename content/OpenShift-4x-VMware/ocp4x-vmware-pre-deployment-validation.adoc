= Pre Deployment Environment Verification Checklist

Prior to or as part of the engagement the "Openshift Container Platform (OCP) 4 Prerequisite Checklist" document
was delivered.

As part of the engagement that checklist was filled out per deployed environment. Those external documents
can be referenced here:
* TODO_environment_1_name - TODO_link_or_describe_location_of_completed_checklist_for_environment_1
* TODO_environment_2_name - TODO_link_or_describe_location_of_completed_checklist_for_environment_2

It is recommended for any future OpenShift 4.x clusters that are created that the same check list be followed.
