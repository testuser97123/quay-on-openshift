= Running Containers with Red Hat Technical Overview (RH065)

*Course description*

A basic introduction to container management in Red Hat Enterprise Linux

Linux containers are an increasingly important technology that allows you to deploy your applications with their entire runtime environment and easily move them between different operating environments (dev, test, and production) in a reliable, scalable, and trusted way.  Containers provide your team with tools that can be used to help implement DevOps and CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous deployment) practices and other elements of a cloud-native application approach.  Running Containers with Red Hat Technical Overview (RH065) provides a basic introduction to container management in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Students will learn what containers are and how to use them to deploy software applications on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server.
